Need to implement data structure for joints and blocks shown in fig. 11 from paper - gives complete description and then calls it in supplemental stuff, but not specifically included.

So far the stuff that is drawn from YADE looks like it's actually from Eigen? (Vector3r and Matrix3r)
They use simple linear algebra vector operations such as cross-product, normalize and matrix-vector multiply

All the LP stuff is done using IBM ILOG CPLEX
